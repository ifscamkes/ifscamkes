We are thankful to Data61 and seL4 developer's community for making CAmkES 3.5.0 available for free public use and development purposes.

IFS-CAmkES, kSIFS-CAmkES, kIFS-CAmkES and Static IFS-CAmkES are our initial attempt in making CAmkES based systems information flow secure. We have released ifscamkes 1.0, ksifscamkes 1.0, kifscamkes 1.0 and static ifscamkes 1.0 in our endeavor to help the community and further collaboration to make them more robust. We would be grateful for any suggestions towards improving them.
